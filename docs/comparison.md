# Comparison to other reader modes

Unlike every other "reader mode", Unclutter modifies the HTML of article pages instead of replacing it. The goal behind this is to improve readability without making all pages look the same (which undos one of the most fun parts of the internet).

Here's the otherwise excellent and indispensable Firefox reader mode vs Unclutter:

| Firefox                                          | Unclutter                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |

In addition to keeping the original website styles, Unclutter also supports many more features likes [page outlines](https://github.com/lindylearn/unclutter/blob/main/docs/outline.md), [social comments](https://github.com/lindylearn/unclutter/blob/main/docs/social-highlights.md), or [automatic activation](https://github.com/lindylearn/unclutter/blob/main/docs/article-detection.md).

For a short intro to how it works technically, see [README.md](https://github.com/lindylearn/unclutter#how-this-works).
