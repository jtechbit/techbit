# Highlights

With Unclutter you can easily save highlights and create notes by simply selecting any article text:

Open the library modal (by pressing `TAB`) to browse and full-text search across your highlights.
 
To disable or enable the feature, click on the "pen" icon in the top right of the article view.

## Hypothes.is sync

You can optionally synchronize your highlights with [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is)
in order to access them on different devices or to import them into note-taking apps.

To configure this:

1. Enable the "Sync my highlights with Hypothes.is" option in the Unclutter extension settings.
2. Create a free [Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/signup?utm_source=lindylearn.io) if you don't already have one.
3. Generate your [API token](https://hypothes.is/account/developer) and enter it in the Unclutter extensions settings.
4. From now on, all highlights & edits you make inside Unclutter or using the official Hypothes.is interface will turn up in both places.

To configure imports to Obsidian, Roam, or other note-taking apps, see [these plugins](https://web.hypothes.is/tools-plug-ins-and-integrations/#:~:text=For%20note%2Dtaking%20apps).
